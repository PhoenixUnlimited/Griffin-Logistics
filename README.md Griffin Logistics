Griffin Logistics as a blockchain project is the culmination of many years of developing, learning and self growth
It is a creation of not only blockchain tech and perseverance, but it is also a journey into freedom and self-sovereignty
Griffin Logistics is an: internet-based: platform. designed to unleash the power of the American spirit, hard work and the self-sovereign movement of cargoes within all 3 sectors of global LAW.
LAW within Christian nations such as The United States of America are based in 3 components
: From the Bible: Genesis: Mankind has dominion over Land, Air and Water. These are the basis for L-A-W.
This LAW consists of three elements just as the three letters L,A and W come from God's directive over humanity to have dominion over the Land, Air and Water. The three elements of LAW come from this religious directive 
"LAW of the Land" (AKA continental) is adhered to due to the movement of cargoes over approved inland shipping lanes, being moved from inland port A to inland port B
"LAW of the Air" (AKA Ether) is adhered to through the magic and evolving nature of the modern internet and its many sovereign jurisdictions within the scope over international cargoes.
"LAW of the Water" (AKA Maritime) is adhered to through the use of: Flag-Law. as well as proper globally accepted contract punctuation along with clear and consise language
Also, Maritime LAW under Universal Postal Union [Hereafter, refered to as "UPU"] jurisdiction regarding approved ships/shipping lanes and the mailing of continental cargoes of all kinds
The UPU jurisdiction is based in international LAW established October 9th, 1874
The UPU is located in Berne, Switzerland
The UPU has set up a paradigm of guidlines for corporate structures such as "ports" and what they call "quays" or "wharves"
Startiing as an Umbrella-Construct, many countries and nations began contractiong with them imediately to move bills of lading from point A to point B ports, globally
The creation of this paradigm established flag communications as a globally acceptable form of communication mainly for ships moving cargoes as well as the movement of cargoes within continental utility between sovereign countries and nations
The UPU set up legislation and passed bills for global functionality regarding the movement of cargo/mail around the world
The UPU paradigm has been utilized by countries around the world for their domestic as well as international cargo/mail needs ever since
Flag LAW communications have been in use for a very long time and continue to be a valid international form of communication in the movement of cargoes within cross-boarder logistics and mail service
